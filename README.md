# SDC-Products

Overview
A backend server and database of product information for an e-commerce web app. The objective is to replace an existing API with a back end system that can support the full data set for the project and to scale to meet the demands of production traffic.

I will be designing a PostgreSQL database and server, and then deploying to AWS EC2 and scaling the service to support at minimum 1k RPS(requests per second) on AWS EC2 using a t2.micro instance.

Phase Description
 - Phase 0: Picking a project and initial setup
 - Phase 1: Create the Database
 - Phase 2: Create the API
 - Phase 3: Performance Tune the Service
 - Phase 4: Deploy and Benchmark Initial Performance
 - Phase 5: Scale the Application
